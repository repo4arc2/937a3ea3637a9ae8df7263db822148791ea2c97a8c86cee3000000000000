1
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,080
只要有他们的签名就行了
Needed their signatures.

2
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,660
我和你说 这根本不是问题
I'm telling you, it's not a problem.

3
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,250
我们还得再等等 市场会好起来的
We have to wait a little. The market's gonna turn around

4
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,040
一切就都没问题了
and everything will be fine.

5
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,660
好吧 咱们得把房子卖了
Okay. We have to sell the penthouse.

6
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,250
不用 没那个必要
No. We don't.

7
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,950
-那是… -是什么 能解决问题的办法 
-That's, that's--What? An actual solution?

8
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,870
也许在这里生活了这么多年
Maybe growing up in this place, you got used to the idea

9
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,000
你总觉得有天上掉馅饼的好事 但是并非如此
that a solution will just fall out of the sky. But it won't.

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,540
你得为女儿考虑
You've got a daughter to think of.

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,200
我会处理好的 埃莉诺
I've got it under control, Eleanor.

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,660
该死
Damn it.

13
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,910
你去吗 
Do you want to?

14
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,000
开什么玩笑 当然是你去
Who are we kidding? You go.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,080
凯特 
Kate?

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,500
我进来了
Coming in.

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,870
你不该偷听的
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

18
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,290
那我怎么知道我不在的时候 你们在说什么 
Then how would I know what you're saying when I'm not there?

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,290
这个理由我还真没法反驳
I don't know how to argue with that.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,660
你听见了多少 
How much did you hear?

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,160
我不想搬家
I don't want to move.

22
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,580
听见了这么多啊 
That much, huh?

23
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,870
-咱们不用搬家 -你怎么知道 
-We don't have to. -How do you know?

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,160
妈妈说天上不会掉馅饼的
Mommy said things don't just fall from the sky.

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,750
好吧 但是天总有不测风云的
Well, yeah, but there's always gonna be weather.

26
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,950
这种时候 人们往往会忘了自己 力所能及的事情
Some people forget the one thing they can control,

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,040
他们其实是可以作选择的
the choices they make in the face of it.

28
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,290
面对〝不测风云〟的时候你会怎么做 
What would you do in a hurricane?

29
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,160
我会和平时一样
I would do what I always do.

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,330
保护你
Protect you.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,870
现在 去和妈妈一起吃午餐好不好 
Now, why don't you go have some lunch with your mom?

32
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,040
机灵点
Think fast.

33
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,200
我要去楼下的办公室
I'll be downstairs in my office.

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,910
妈妈其实也会搞怪
Mommies can be pretty fun, too, you know.

35
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,000
你肯定不知道我还有这个本事
I bet you didn't know I could do this.

36
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,620
好玩吧
Made you smile.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,910
来吧
Come on.

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,080
要不去把跳棋拿过来  咱们玩点好玩的
Why don't you go grab the Checkers? We can liven things up.

39
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,290
-好吗  -好的
-All right. Yeah. -Yeah?

40
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,330
好 我下楼一趟 这就回来
Okay, I'm going downstairs, I'll be right back.

41
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,290
好
Okay.

42
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,500
妈妈
Mommy!

43
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,580
妈妈 怎么回事 
Mommy? Mommy, what's happening?

44
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,540
妈妈
Mommy!

45
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,410
爸爸 你在哪 
Daddy, where are you?

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,160
爸爸 
Dad?

47
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,620
爸爸 你在哪 
Dad. Daddy, where are you?

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,370
妈妈
Mommy!

49
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
凯特
Kate!

50
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,790
咱们得逃出去
We have to get out of here.

51
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,660
爸爸没事吧 
Is Daddy okay?

52
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
爸爸
Dad!

53
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,290
爸爸
Dad! Dad!

54
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,580
爸爸
Daddy!

55
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,870
节哀顺变 亲爱的
I'm so sorry, my dear.

56
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,290
它们要是又回来了呢 
What if they come back?

57
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,540
它们不会回来的
They won't come back.

58
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,000
你怎么知道 
How do you know?

59
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,830
因为那些英雄 让它们见识了我们的厉害
Because the heroes showed them what would happen.

60
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,910
即便经历了这样恐怖的时刻
And even though this is scary,

61
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,750
我仍然是这个世界上最幸运的女人
I'm still the luckiest woman in the world

62
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,700
因为我拥有这个世界上 最棒的小女孩
because I have the greatest little girl in the world.

63
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,040
现在她已经不是小女孩了
Who is not that little.

64
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,080
我要保护好你和我
I need to protect us.

65
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,700
凯特 那是我该做的事
Kate, that's my job.

66
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,830
好吗 
Okay?

67
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,080
你需要我的时候 我永远在你身边
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.

68
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,660
我需要一副弓箭
I need a bow and arrow.

69
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,950
漫威影业出品

70
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,540
根据漫威漫画改编

71
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,540
鹰眼

72
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,450
斯坦恩塔

73
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,660
现在

74
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,790
来吧
Ugh! Come on!

75
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,790
格里尔

76
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,370
凯特 小心点
Kate, be careful.

77
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,830
如果被抓到 你肯定会被赶出射箭队
If we get caught, you're definitely gonna be kicked off the archery team.

78
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,500
我知道 但是我说话算话 格里尔
Yeah, I know. But a bet's a bet, Greer.

79
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,370
好吧 现在问题来了
Okay, so the real question.

80
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,540
是让大钟摇晃 还是让大钟里面的那玩意摇晃
Does the bell swing back and forth, or the dangly thingy swing back and forth?

81
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,750
当然是钟了
It's obviously the bell.

82
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,450
是吗 我的想法不一样
See? I would disagree.

83
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,910
我觉得应该是里面那玩意
I think it's the dangly thingy.

84
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,790
打扮不错 凯特
Nice outfit by the way, Kate.

85
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,160
好吧
Yeah, well,

86
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,950
有的时候还是得打扮一下
sometimes, you gotta dress the part.

87
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,160
虽说是打赌
I know it's a bet,

88
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,330
但是你确定弓箭不会把它弄坏吧 
but are you sure that arrow won't damage it?

89
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,750
不会
No.

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,370
这可太让人失望了
Well, that was a bit of a letdown.

91
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,080
好吧 你们稍等
Okay, you know what, just hang on.

92
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,830
稍等
Hang on.

93
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,660
让我调整一下 别着急
Let me just fix this. Give me a second.

94
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,410
天啊 这太厉害了
Oh, my God! That was amazing! Wow!

95
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,580
漂亮 凯特
Nice, Kate.

96
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,330
这样挺好
That's fine.

97
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,870
对吧 这钟现在可不一样了 所有出名的大钟都有裂痕
Right? I mean, it gives it character. All famous bells have cracks in them.

98
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,580
好吧 这可不妙
All right, that's, uh, that's not great.

99
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,450
没准会更糟糕
But it could be worse.

100
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,410
这下糟了
This is bad.

101
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,450

灭霸做的没错

149
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,410
要是能和您自拍一个就太好了
Oh, uh, a selfie would be really rad, dude.

150
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,910
孩子们会很高兴的 你绝对是他们的最爱
My kids would flip. I mean, you're their absolute favorite.

151
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,790
好吧…
Yeah, uh...

152
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,830
现在不太合适
Now's not really the appropriate time.

153
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,500
现在合适了吗 
Is now a better time?

154
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,830
-你还好吗  -没事
-Hey, are you okay? -Oh, hey, yeah.

155
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,000
我就是出来…
Yeah, yeah. I, uh, just wanted to come out for some, uh...

156
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,080
透透气而已
Some fresh air, is all.

157
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,830
要是你不想看 没关系的
You know it's fine if you don't wanna watch the show. I mean...

158
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,700
我知道大家都很想念她
I know everyone misses her, but...

159
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,450
而她又是你最好的朋友
she was your best friend. It's...

160
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,000
过来 亲爱的
Come here, baby.

161
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,870
事情有点荒谬 是不是 
This whole thing is a bit ridiculous, isn't it?

162
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,540
太荒谬了
A lot ridiculous.

163
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,750
-浩克那部分最棒了 -对 我喜欢浩克
-The Hulk part was great. -Yeah, I liked the Hulk.

164
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,120
爸爸 莱拉
Hey, Dad. Hey, Lila.

165
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,870
怎么了 你们怎么出来了 
Hey, guys! What's up? What are you doing here?

166
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,870
为什么大家都要又唱又跳的 
Why is everyone singing and dancing about everything?

167
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,870
我也不知道
I don't know.

168
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,000
这就是纽约的圣诞节 咱们得好好感受一下 对吗 
But it's Christmas in New York. And we're out of here. Right?

169
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,450
-对 -咱们走吧
-Yeah. -Let's go.

170
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,750
-好的 -让妈妈看看她错过了什么
All right. -Let's show Mom what she's missing.

171
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,700
好
Yeah.

172
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,870
来吧
-Come on, bud.

173
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,250
妈妈
Hey, Mom!

174
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,120
亲爱的 我可真想你啊
Hey, honey! I missed you.

175
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,950
-你在城里吗  -是的
-Uh, are you in the city? -Yeah, I, uh, I am.

176
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,290
我先回趟家 然后去找你
I was gonna stop by my place and then come see you.

177
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,250
你能先过来吗 杰克来了
Will you come here first, please? Jack's over.

178
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,040
我有事要和你说
I want to talk to you about something.

179
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,290
好的 等会见 妈妈
Okay, uh, okay. I'll, uh, see you soon, Mom.

180
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,540
晚上好 毕肖普小姐
Good evening, Miss Bishop.

181
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,200
最近怎么样  家里人都还好吗 
How's it going? Good? Wife, kids, all good?

182
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,330
都挺好的 圣诞快乐
Wonderful, wonderful, Merry Christmas!

183
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,540
-亲爱的 -妈妈
-Hi, sweetie. -Hi, Mom.

184
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,750
你回来了
There you are.

185
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
你看上去真漂亮
Oh, you look amazing.

186
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,080
为什么要打扮得这么隆重 
What are we looking all fancy for?

187
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,580
慈善拍卖
Charity auction.

188
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,200
我知道你在想什么
-Ugh. -I know, right?

189
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,540
那些穷人和非营利性组织 都要依赖富人
All those poor people and nonprofits relying on the more fortunate.

190
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,950
我不是这个意思
That is not what I meant.

191
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,040
虽然你回家过节我很开心
As much as I love having you home for the holidays,

192
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,080
但是要去重修一座钟楼 我可一点都不开心
I'm not thrilled that I'm about to replace an irreplaceable clock tower.

193
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,870
其实那个钟楼不算大
It was a bell tower.

194
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,500
校长说有一个小钟 还有一个大钟
The Dean said it had a bell and a clock,

195
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,790
你本事真够大的 一次把两个都毁了
and overachiever that you are, you managed to destroy both.

196
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,500
我能做点什么吗 妈妈 
What can I do to make it better, Mom?

197
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,660
我要先取消你的信用卡
I started by cancelling your credit cards,

198
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,370
然后咱们得认真谈谈 你毁掉的这个钟楼
and we're going to have a much longer talk about this tower that you destroyed,

199
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,290
我没开玩笑
without joking.

200
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,830
我知道年轻人觉得自己所向无敌
I know young people think they're invincible,

201
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,080
有钱人觉得自己可以为所欲为 你又年轻又有钱
and rich people think they're invincible and you've always been both.

202
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,750
别自以为是了 你根本没那么强大
So take it from someone who hasn't, you're not.

203
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,700
你也会受伤的
You will get hurt.

204
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,000
所以拜托 能不能不要自找麻烦
So please, don't go out looking for it.

205
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,540
对不起 妈妈
Sorry, Mom.

206
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,950
对不起
Sorry.

207
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,750
好吧
Okay.

208
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,330
你真是完美继承了你爸爸
You get that from your father, you know.

209
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,410
你要不要首先补偿一下我
Why don't you start making it up to me

210
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,080
穿上卧室那件红色的礼服 今晚跟我一起出席晚宴 
by putting on that red dress in your bedroom and coming with me tonight?

211
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,660
没问题
All right, well, um,

212
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,660
还有件事
on another note,

213
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,160
我又拿了一个奖牌
I got a new one for the case.

214
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,790
美国武术公开赛冠军
U.S. Open Martial Art Championship.

215
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,870
你真厉害 我还记得 你15岁拿到黑带的时候
You're amazing. I still remember when you got your black belt at 15.

216
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,040
咱们得清走一些你小时候的奖杯 腾点地方了吧
We might have to retire some from when you were little to make room. Huh?

217
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,370
-我喜欢那些奖杯 -我也是 亲爱的
-I like those. -I do, too, hon.

218
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,500
我也是
I do, too.

219
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,410
这些剑是干什么的 
What's with all the swords, Mom?

220
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,080
亲爱的 这学期你不在 家里有些变化
Hon, uh, there have been a few changes while you were away this semester.

221
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,620
看
Ta-da!

222
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
杰克 
Jack?

223
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
给你个意外的惊喜
What an unexpected surprise.

224
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,790
惊喜哪有不意外的
All surprises are unexpected.

225
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,950
也不一定吧 是不是 
That can't be right. Is it?

226
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,910
很高兴再次见到你 凯特
Nice to see you again, Katie.

227
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,870
你刚从嘴里拿出来
That was in your mouth.

228
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,200
说的也是
So it was.

229
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,950
咱们不能迟到 快去换衣服吧
We cannot be late, so go change.

230
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,950
咱们酒店见 到时候再说 好吗 
Meet us at the hotel and we'll talk there. Okay?

231
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,330
-走吧  -走
-Shall we? -Let's.

232
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,700
咱们宴会上见
We'll see you at the party.

233
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,290
等会见 亲爱的
See you there, honey.

234
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,580
要说的还多着呢
Lots more to talk about.

235
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,950
你看上去像个疯子
You look like a maniac.

236
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
完全不正常
You're a total crazy person.

237
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,040
还有人没吃饱吗 
Is anybody else hungry?

238
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,950
要不要再点些螃蟹 再来四只 
For some more, like, some more crabs or maybe get four more crabs?

239
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,870
-怎么样  -我能吃三只
-What do you think? -Yes. I could eat three.

240
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,040
-不了 -算了 爸爸 这些都够30个人吃的了
-No. -Come on, Dad, you ordered food for 30 people.

241
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,330
再吃就该吐了
You're going to puke if you have any more.

242
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,580
如果他吐了 你们俩得负责清理
And if he pukes, you two are cleaning it up.

243
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,910
我才不管呢
I'm not cleaning it up.

244
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,950
要不这样吧 你们知道街那边有什么吗 
Hey, you know what? You know what's right down the street?

245
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,120
圣诞树 你们这辈子 绝对没见过那么大的
The Christmas tree. The biggest one you'll see in your life.

246
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,450
超级巨大 吃完饭想不想去看看 
It's enormous! You want to see that after this?

247
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,000
-太棒了 -行 咱们去看看
-Yeah! -Yeah! Let's go.

248
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
等等
-Oh, wait, wait, wait.

249
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,660
妈妈打电话来了 问个好
Momma callin'. Momma's calling. Say "Hi!"

250
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,450
妈妈好
-Hi, Mom! -Hi, Momma!

251

大家好啊 你们怎么样

我太想你们了
I miss you so much!

253
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,330
-我们也很想你 -演出怎么样 
-We miss you, too. How was the show?

254
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,660
演出…结束了 挺热闹的
It was, uh-- It's over. It was big.

255

-我们看了一半就走了 -没错
-We left halfway through. -There you go.

256
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,870

你们还好吗 
You guys all good?

258
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,910
挺好的 要是你在就更好了
Uh, yeah, it'd be easier if you were here.

259
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,120
我就不会扫孩子们的兴了
I'd be less likely to strangle these kids.

260
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,500
本来就是让你多陪陪孩子们的
The whole point was for you to spend time with the kids.

261
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,450
没事 我开玩笑的 我们玩得挺开心的
No, I'm kidding. We're having a really good time.

-I can't wait to see you guys tomorrow. Bye, Mom!

264
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,410
再见 妈妈 爱你
Bye, Mom! Love you! -Bye, Mom.

265
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,910
晚点再和你说 回头见
-Talk to you later. See you soon. Bye-bye.

266
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,370
还有六天就圣诞节了 对吗 
Well, look, it's six days until Christmas, okay?

267
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,660
咱们要做的事还多着呢 你最想做的是什么 
We're gonna do a lot of activities. What's your favorite one?

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,660
圣诞电影马拉松
Uh, Christmas movie marathon.

271
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,000
电影马拉松 太棒了

272
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,540
-圣诞毛衣 -丑丑的圣诞毛衣
-Uh, ugly sweaters. -Ugly Christmas sweaters!

273
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,580
咱们还得装饰圣诞树呢 要做的事太多了
We have to decorate the tree. There's a thousand things to do.

274
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,870
一切都会很有趣的 而且最重要的是
It's going to be amazing, but most important thing,

275
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,160
咱们要一起做
we're going to do it all together.

276
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,790
不 我不要跟他们拉手
No. Not holding their hands.

277
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,290
拉着你兄弟的手
Hold your brothers' hands.

278

284
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,660
-谢谢你 -用不着这样
-Thank you. -Oh, that's, that's not necessary.

285
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,290
这是应该的 您拯救了这座城市
It's necessary. You saved our city.

286
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,870
谢谢您
Oh. Thank you.

287
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,200

-不好意思 亲爱的 你能不能… -抱歉 我不是服务生
-Excuse me dear, would you--Sorry, I'm not a waitress.

291
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,000
你是毕肖普家的女儿
You're the little Bishop girl.

292
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,750
是的
Yes, I am.

293
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,120
我是阿曼德 阿曼德•杜凯恩
-Armand. Armand Duquesne. -Ah.

294
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,750
你原来经常来我家喝早茶
You used to come to my brownstone for brunch.

295
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,500
对 你家可以煎薄饼
Oh, build your own blintz bar.

296
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,450
没错
Precisely.

297
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,620
这太不公平了
You know, it's unfair.

298
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,910
我这辈子都没有 你穿上燕尾服那么好看
I never looked that good in a tuxedo in my life.

299
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,370
如果婚礼上你能再穿的淑女点 我就谢天谢地了
I'd appreciate it if you wear something a little more lady-like for the wedding,

300
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,870
这样你就不会和我抢风头了
so we won't be competing.

301
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,700
什么婚礼 
What wedding?

302
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,910
你还不知道吗 
You don't know?

303
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,290
埃莉诺和杰克
Eleanor and Jack.

304
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,660
这对小情侣还挺能保密的
Oh! Those secretive little love birds!

305
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,580
-您要来杯香槟吗  -谢谢
Can I offer you some champagne? -Thank you!

306
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,450
相信我 为了让他放弃结婚 我能干的都干了
Believe me, I've done everything in my power to talk him out of it.

307
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,660
他那个小脑瓜一旦拿定主意
When he gets something set in that little mind of his,

308
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,870
可是不撞南墙不回头
he can be quite determined.

309
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,660
是啊
Oh.

310
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,290
他这也算是中头彩了
Seems like he won the jackpot.

311
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,540
你这么觉得吗 
You think so?

312
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,700
他也这么觉得
So does he.

313
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,410
我可不这么觉得
I'm not so sure.

314
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,870
阿曼德 我想回家了 这太无聊了
Armand, I wanna go home. I'm bored.

315
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,120
注意你的说话方式 阿曼德 咱们的家教可不是这样的
That's no way to talk, Armand. That's not the way you were brought up.

316
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,040
来和毕肖普小姐打个招呼
Come and say hello to Miss Bishop.

317
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,950
你好
Hey.

318
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,370
你好
Hello.

319
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,620
又一个阿曼德啊
Another Armand, I see.

320
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,540
是的 我是阿曼德三世 他是阿曼德七世
Yes. I'm Armand the third and he's Armand the seventh.

321
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,580
我们家可真是人丁兴旺
I believe that's quite sufficient.

322
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,660
我先失陪了
Well, uh, I'm gonna make my excuses because it seems that

323
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,790
你最好和你那位〝头彩〟的母亲
you need to have a chat

324
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,200
认真谈谈
with your prize of a mother.

325
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,160
走吧 阿曼德
Come on, Armand. Come on, boy!

326
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,660
你们订婚了 
You're engaged?

327
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,450
好吧 看来纸里包不住火
Oh, well, I guess the beans are out of the bag.

328
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,040
我们能单独呆会吗 
Well, can we have a little moment?

329
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,080
当然 我也该去和别人聊聊了
Oh, of course, it's almost time for my other engagement anyway.

330
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,120
再见
Bye.

331
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,080
宝贝 抱歉这个时候才让你知道
Babe, I'm sorry, I'm sorry you found out this way.

332
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,410
我不知道 妈妈 这好像有点…
I don't know, Mom, this is just like...

333
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,250
-太快了 -是的 确实挺快的
-Fast. -Yeah, yeah, it's fast, yes.

334
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,540
但是 沉浸在爱情里的感觉也不错
But, you know, it's kind of nice being swept up in the romance of it.

335
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,120
你能不能尽量为我感到高兴点呢 
Is there a part of you that could be happy for me?

336
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,040
可以
Yes.

337
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,580
当然可以 妈妈
Yes, Mom, of course.

338
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,330
对不起 我想要第一个告诉你的 真的对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I wanted to tell you first. I'm sorry.

339
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,330
-我出去透透气 妈妈 -我明白
-I'm going to get some air, Mom. -I understand.

340
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,540
那就好
Yep.

341
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,120
-记得回来找我 好吗  -没问题
-Come back and find me, okay? -Yeah.

342

你好
-Hi. -

343
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,040
这宴会太无聊了 是不是 
Heck of a party, huh?

344
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,080
我早就该猜到 你的一切都是谎言
I should've known that this empire of yours would be built on a lie.

345
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,790
我可是白手起家 你看到的那些都不是真的
By myself from the ground up. So whatever you think you saw is not true.

346
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,500
不要侮辱我的智商
Don't insult my intelligence.

347
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,080
是你在侮辱你我的智商
You're frankly insulting us both.

348
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,410
-我知道我看到了什么 -你们都只是…
-I know what I saw. -You are all just--

349
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,910
少跟我来这套
Don't you try that on me.

350
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,580
我给你解释的机会了
I gave you an opportunity to explain yourself.

351
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,290
我不想和你吵架
I don't want to argue with you.

352
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,200
有权有势的朋友我也有 你绝对惹不起
I've got powerful friends, too. The kind you don't want to mess with.

353
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
拜托
Please.

354
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200

356
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,410
妈妈 那是怎么回事  他在威胁你吗 
Mom, what was that about? Is that guy threatening you?

357
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,410
其实…我也不知道
I honestly-- I have no idea.

358
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,330
你为什么会躲在走廊里 
Why are you lurking in the hallways?

359
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,910
-我在外面透透气 -回宴会去吧
-I was outside getting air. -Come back to the party.

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,160
-好吧 -好的
-Okay. All right. -Okay.

362
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,500
-我失陪一下 -好
-Be right back. -Okay.

363
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,660

I've reached my breaking point with your fiancÃ©e.

368
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,040
我可要跟她翻脸了
Things are about to get very ugly.

369
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,620
你就放过埃莉诺吧 老古董
Why don't we leave Eleanor alone, you old goat.

谁让你来这里的 
Who told you to come down here?

391
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,620
盖瑞
Gary.

你看 这就是问题所在 盖瑞
You see that's the problem, Gary,

395
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,660
你连我的名字都不知道
you don't even know my name.

396
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,750
太过分了 我不干了
You know, uh, this is, this is not gonna work out. I quit.

An artifact recovered from the wreckage of the Avengers compound.

407
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,540
你们一定还记得那个消灭了 地下犯罪团伙的浪人
Now you may recall the Ronin decimated the criminal underworld of the city,

408
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,160
他让犯罪组织的头目一蹶不振
almost completely annihilating the status and power of the head of organized crime.

409
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,080
他的正义审判残酷血腥
The Ronin brought a brutal form of justice to his victims,

410
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,910
而他的身份至今仍然是个谜
